**Split Screen Volume** is a small utility app for the **AYANEO Pocket DS** that lets you manage volume for the top and bottom screens seperately using a clean popup control UI.

---

## What it does

- Provides a simple **popup volume control** that replaces the stock slier when you press the volume buttons with **three vertical sliders**:
  - **Media**
  - **Top**
  - **Bottom**
- Keeps the main screen minimal and straightforward.
- Uses **Shizuku** for the permissions needed to control audio behavior.

---

## Requirements

### 1) Shizuku (required)
This app relies on **Shizuku** to function.

If Shizuku is not installed, the app will show a button that links to the Play Store.

### 2) Starting Shizuku on AYANEO Pocket DS
If Shizuku **is installed**, you still need to start it.

On the AYANEO Pocket DS, start Shizuku in root mode via:

**AyaSettings → Device → Root Script → Start Shizuku in root mode**

Once Shizuku is running, Split Screen Volume will show:

**“Service running”**

---

## How to use

1. Install **Split Screen Volume**
2. Install **Shizuku** (if you don’t already have it)
3. Start Shizuku using the AYANEO Pocket DS steps above
4. Open Split Screen Volume
5. When you see **“Service running”**, you’re good to go
6. Press the volume buttons and use the popup UI sliders to adjust:
   - **Media**
   - **Top**
   - **Bottom**

## Troubleshooting

### The app says “Waiting for Shizuku service”
- Confirm Shizuku is installed
- Open Shizuku and ensure it’s started
- On Pocket DS, use:  
  **AyaSettings → Device → Root Script → Start Shizuku in root mode**

### Sliders don’t respond / feel weird
- Make sure Shizuku is running first
- Restart the app after starting Shizuku if needed

## Credits / Notes

- Built for the **AYANEO Pocket DS** use case.
